# Module-Unsupervised-Learning

Containing modularized cells/script blocks demonstrating how to do with introduction/desciption:

1. K-Means for Clustering
2. PCA (Principle Component Analysis), Randomized PCA, Incremental PCA for dimensionality reduction
3. LLE (Locally Linear Embedding) for dimensionality reduction
4. Isomap (Isometric Mapping) for dimensionality reduction
5. MDS (Multidimensional Scaling) for dimensionality reduction
6. t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) for dimensionality reduction
7. DBSCAN for Clustering
8. Spectral Clustering and Agglomerative Clustering

See the Autoencoder project for automatic label generation/classification with multiple dimension reduction methos and unsupervised learning algorithms combined.
