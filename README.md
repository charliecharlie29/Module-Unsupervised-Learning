# Module-Unsupervised-Learning

Containing modularized cells/script blocks demonstrating how to do:

1. K-Means for Clustering
2. PCA (Principle Component Analysis), Randomized PCA, Incremental PCA for dimensionality reduction
3. LLE (Locally Linear Embedding) for dimensionality reduction
4. Isomap (Isometric Mapping) for dimensionality reduction
5. MDS (Multidimensional Scaling) for dimensionality reduction
6. t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) for dimensionality reduction
